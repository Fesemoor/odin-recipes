    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a classic peruvian dessert, very popular in the city of Lima. It's easy to prepare and irresistible to taste. (6 servings)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>12 fluid ounces of evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 beaten egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 beaten egg white</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, vanilla, and egg yolks in a saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and gently cook until the mixture thickens, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, about 30 minutes. Pour into a heatproof serving dish and set aside.</li>
        <li>Whip the egg whites with confectioners' sugar to stiff peaks. Spread meringue on top of milk mixture. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. Sprinkle with cinnamon before serving, if desired.</li>
        <li>You can also pasteurize your egg whites (in case you are pregnant, you are infirm, an elder or young children), you can make a Swiss meringue: combine the 2 egg whites with about 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a stainless steel mixing bowl. Heat over a double boiler, stirring constantly, until sugar is melted and egg whites are hot to the touch. Remove from heat and whip until fluffy and stiff. </li>
    </ol>
